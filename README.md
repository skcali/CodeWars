# CodeWars Code Practice

Working on JavaScript and C# problems in CodeWars everyday while unemployeed to keep my mind sharp, practice code tests, and keep my GitHub active. 

Working on these in my own IDE, either VSCode or VS2017, and writing my own tests or copying tests from the kata. You can tell which kata it is by the file or solution name then the number next to it is the level of difficulty, from 1-8, 1 being the hardest.
